This is a simple MVC based PHP framework.
It is one of the most basic MVC frameworks in PHP. It can be improved by adding many more features such as caching and security.
We are using Eloquent (ORM) to communicate with the database.

It follows the following pattern.
http:mvc/public/home/create/rogerthat/password/roger/federer

mvc/public is the base url
home is the controller
create is the controller method
rogerthat,password,roger,federer are the arguments to the create method

Home is the default controller.
Index is the defualt method. Thus it is necessary to create an index method in each class.

A special thanks to Alex from CodeCourse.com
Must appreciate the way explained in detail about how to go ahead with a basic MVC framework from scratch.

Please feel free to modify it and bring to the gotchas, if any to my notice.
